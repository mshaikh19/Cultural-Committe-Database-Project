# Cultural-Committe-Database-Project

## 📌 Project Overview

The Cultural Committee Database System is an academic project developed as part of the Database Management System (DBMS) course. The project focuses on analyzing a real-world organizational problem and designing an efficient database solution for managing cultural committee activities at DAU.

The primary goal of this project is to understand the complete database development lifecycle, including requirement gathering, SRS preparation, conceptual database design, logical database design, and implementation. A basic website interface is developed only to demonstrate the functionality and working of the designed database.

The system provides a structured method to manage event details, student participation, committee members, and registrations while ensuring data consistency and reduced redundancy.
